1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,070
- [Voiceover] Hey folks, this is Chad Perkins,

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,020
a filmmaker from Seattle.

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,040
This training series is part of a collection of courses

4
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,060
to teach you how to make a short film, start to finish.

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,050
As part of this training,

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,070
I made a short fantasy film called The Assurance,

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,020
and documented the entire process,

8
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,040
from writing and pre-production,

9
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,010
to working on set, through post-production,

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,040
to a screening in an independent movie theater in Seattle.

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,050
In this training, you'll get to see how we budgeted,

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,030
auditioned actors, set up lights and cameras,

13
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,050
wrote and recorded the orchestral score,

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,040
how we did all of our visual effects, everything.

15
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,020
You know, filmmaking is really about problem-solving,

16
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,060
so we'll show you the first drafts and rough cuts,

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,050
the challenges we had, the mistakes we made,

18
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,050
so that you can avoid those pitfalls on your projects.

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,030
This training consists of 13 separate training courses.

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,070
Each course focuses on a component of filmmaking

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,040
and will be released in the general order

22
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,020
of the filmmaking workflow.

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,080
The first course is on producing.

24
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,030
How do you get a project off the ground

25
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,000
and shepherd it to completion?

26
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,050
The second course is on writing.

27
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,040
We'll get an understanding of how to tell a story,

28
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,050
examining some of the best Hollywood films,

29
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,000
as well as how we created the world The Assurance.

30
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,990
Course number three is about pre-production,

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,080
getting the script ready to film.

32
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,040
We'll look at the meetings I had with our crew

33
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,010
about the schedule, budget,

34
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,060
designing the wardrobe from scratch,

35
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,070
developing concept art, and more.

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,990
The fourth course is on acting.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,990
We'll look at what acting is really about

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,040
and we'll show you our auditions and rehearsals

39
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,050
and why we made the choices we did.

40
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,010
The fifth course is about directing,

41
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,080
where we'll look at controlling the tone, running the set,

42
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,060
and the many decisions that directors have to make.

43
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,080
Course number six is all about working on set.

44
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,030
What's that workflow like?

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,990
What do all these people do?

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,990
We'll look at all of that,

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,030
as well as a tutorial from my wife, Heather,

48
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,030
about how she created the special effects makeup

49
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,080
for our film.

50
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,040
The seventh course is about cinematography.

51
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,020
How can you use your camera and lighting

52
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,000
to tell your story in the best way?

53
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,060
Course number eight is about editing

54
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,020
and we'll see how we were able to reedit our initial story

55
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,000
to tell a completely different and much better one.

56
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,070
In course nine, we'll start to look at visual effects,

57
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,060
creating environments, adding elements to shots,

58
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,000
and removing objects from shots.

59
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,080
Course 10 is all about the stuff you think of

60
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,030
when you think of visual effects:

61
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,030
magic, particles, explosions,

62
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,000
you know, all that pretty stuff.

63
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,050
These are all things that you could do at home

64
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,050
for little to no money.

65
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,990
Course 11 is about color.

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,030
This was a huge part of The Assurance

67
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,060
and is an often underused tool

68
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,000
to transform bland footage

69
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,070
or even poorly-shot footage into something gorgeous.

70
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,050
Course 12 is all about audio.

71
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,060
We'll look at recording audio on set, composing the score,

72
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,070
and recording it, sound design,

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,020
and mixing it all together.

74
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,030
Finally, we'll wrap things up in course 13

75
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,990
by talking about how to market and distribute your film,

76
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,040
including how to make marketing materials

77
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,080
like logos and trailers,

78
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,040
and how to get your film seen by an audience.

79
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,990
I think it's a one of a kind experience

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,010
to not just learn about how to make films,

81
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,080
but to see what it's actually like to solve problems

82
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,080
and struggle and fail and compromise during that process.

83
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,080
- Cut.

84
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,030
- Now this has been years in the making,

85
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,060
so thank you so much for watching this.

86
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,070
Enjoy the training.

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,990
- That's a wrap.

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(crowd cheers)
